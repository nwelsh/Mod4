There once was a dog named Scout. Scout was a white poodle who loved to run and sing. Scout had his golden birthday on October 13th and celebrated with a big party with his family. Scout was so happy during his party and he ate all his food and didn't stop smiling for weeks. After Scout's party, however, he had to go to the groomer, and he hated the groomer.
