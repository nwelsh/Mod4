There once was a dog named Scout. Scout was a white poodle who loved to run and sing. Scout had his golden birthday on October 13th and celebrated with a big party with his family. Scout was so happy during his party and he ate all his food and didn't stop smiling for weeks. After Scout's party, however, he had to go to the groomer, and he hated the groomer. 
Rowan: The groomer was never as nice to Scout as his owners were, and he had to get wet too. Scout hated being wet. But there he was after his party and he was very sad as he approached the groomer. The groomer was very understanding and gave him a treat. Scout still didn't like being wet but the groomer used warm water, and it was over before Scout could bark. Scout shook off the water and was headed home!
tyler - Once Scout headed home, he felt amazing. All of his dog friends and human friends alike kept saying how good he looked. He even got a date with a very attractive french bulldog, so he was especially confident. Scout, that night before going to bed, reflected on his day, and realized that although somethings may suck while you do them, they all pay off in the end.
