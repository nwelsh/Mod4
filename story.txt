(idk if this is how we're supposed to do this and idk what the story should be 
about so I wrote it about my puppy)

There once was a dog named Scout. Scout was a white poodle who loved to run and sing. 
Scout had his golden birthday on October 13th and celebrated with a big party with
his family. Scout was so happy during his party and he ate all his food and didn't 
stop smiling for weeks.
